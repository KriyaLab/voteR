# 🗳️ voteR – AI Political Analysis Engine

-  Offline-ready campaign intelligence platform to understand voter mood, identify winning issues, and generate high-impact flyers, slogans, and pitch decks — all powered by a self-hosted LLaMA model.

---

## ⚠️ Showcase-Only (Under NDA)

This repository demonstrates the **architecture**, **workflow**, and **sample outcomes** of the voteR platform.  
🔒 The full production code and datasets are **proprietary** and available **under NDA**.

Want to see it running?

## 🧠 Problem → Solution

### ❌ The Problem

- 🎯 Issues, slogans, and flyers are personalized for each constituency.
- 📊 Pitch decks are auto-generated to guide campaign strategy.

All offline. All self-hosted.

## 🧩 Sample Code Snippet

This is a harmless utility used inside our PDF generator logic:

```python
from reportlab.lib.pagesizes import A4
from reportlab.pdfgen import canvas

def generate_flyer(candidate_name, slogan, output_file):
    c = canvas.Canvas(output_file, pagesize=A4)
    c.setFont("Helvetica-Bold", 20)
    c.drawString(100, 750, f"Vote for {candidate_name}!")
    c.setFont("Helvetica", 14)
    c.drawString(100, 720, f"Slogan: {slogan}")
    c.save()
